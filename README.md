# Java-Casino
A Simple Command Propt Java Casino Program with Mini Games
The main method is located the CasinoTest.java
and most of the code is Casino.java
Hello This is a simple Java Program that copies a slot machine in the casino.
The length of the code is 2500 + lines and I would be happy if someone can make it shorter
If you have any suggestions or comments on how to make the program better please feel free to do so.

The game starts by Showing the user the Start menu.
There are 2 options.
1. Deposit money
2. Exit

exit is pretty self explanatory . 

Once the user chooses to deposit money.The user will be prompt to input how much money he wants to input.
After depositing the user goes to the main menu showing 5 options.
1. Coin games
2. Dice games
3. Lotto games (lottery games)
4. cash out
5. deposit money

Once the user chooses Coin games. the user will be shown the 3 options in the game.
1. 1 coin x 2 wager
2. 2 coin x 3 wager
3. 3 coin x 5 wager
to win the game the user needs to guess if the toss coin will be heads or tails.

The other games are just the same.
All games used are luck based gambling.
